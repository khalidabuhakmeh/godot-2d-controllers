# Godot 4.3 Player Controls for 2D Games

This repository contains multiple scenes with `CharacterBody2D` nodes
with scripts defining a particular control scheme.

Those schemes include the following:

- Platformer
- Top-down Adventure
- Vehicle
- Floaty / Ice Level
- Infinite Runner

The aim is to help folks learning [Godot](https://godotengine.org) have a
starting point when starting to build their game.

Each scene also contains a theme that helps actualize the control schemes and
gives the developer an opportunity to experiment with values.

# Getting Started

The scripts in this repository include both **GDSCRIPT** and **C#** implementations.
If you intend to use the C# scripts, you will need the Mono version of Godot, which is
the version that supports the .NET Runtime.
